# project_evaluation_activity


In this activity you will evaluate an open source project.

You should be working in groups of 3-4 students.

Create a new file in this repository and copy the template from the `project_evaluation.md` into it.
You should name the file by replacing the word "project" in the template by the name of the project you are looking at. (If there are more than one group working on a particular project, then you should append an integer to the end of the file name, ex. `_1.md` or `_3.md`

Answer all the questions in the template based on the information on the project website and in the project repository (DO NOT use a search engine!!!).
