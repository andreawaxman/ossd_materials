# Rubric instructions

The table below contains entries for each of the evaluation criteria in the  [Project Evaluation OpenMRS Activity](project_evaluation_OpenMRS.md). For each criterion, find the evaluation information needed and record it in the "Evaluation Data" column. Then assign a score in the level column using zero to indicate that the criterion is not met at all, two to indicate that the criterion is fully met, and 1 for something in between.

-   __Licensing__ - Score 2 if the product has a free software or open source software license. Score 0 for other licenses or if the license is missing
-   __Language__ - Score 2 if the language is your most preferred choice. Score 1 for less preferred languages or if your preferred language is only a small part of the product. Score 0 if the language is not suitable for your needs
-   __Level of Activity__ - Score 2 if you judge all the quarters in the last year as being active. Score 1 if some of the quarters in the last year have been active. Score 0 if there have been no active quarters in the last year.
-   __Number of Contributors__ - Score 2 if there are 10 or more contributors. Score 1 if there are 3-10 contributors. Score 0 if there are only 1 or 2 contributors. Note that these numbers are based on the fact that most projects have only 1-2 contributors, and the score assumes you are interested in contributing to a larger, clearly established project. If you would prefer to work with a smaller, less well-established project then adjust your scoring to reflect that.
-   __Size__ - Scoring for size depends on your objectives in contributing to a project. A project with little or no code should probably be scored 0. For projects that have an established code base, you might think about whether there is a "sweet spot" for code base size that you think would be ideal for your needs. If you can define that, then score projects in that range as 2. Score projects that are neither 0 or 2 as 1. If you don't know what size would be appropriate, then score anything over a reasonable minimum (suggestion: 10,000 lines) as 1.
-   __Issue Tracker__ - Score 2 if issues are being actively added and resolved. Score 0 if there is no issue tracker or no sign of recent activity. Score 1 if there is activity but it is very low or sporadic.
-   __New Contributor__ - Score 2 if there are clear instructions and welcome for new contributors (positive answers to at least 3 of the learning activity questions). Score 0 if there is little or no evidence of welcome or instructions for new contributors. Score 1 for anything in between.
-   __Community Norms__ - Score 2 if there is a documented and easy to locate statement of community norms that is welcoming and inclusive. Score 0 if there is any evidence of rude, unprofessional, harassing or other undesirable behavior. Score 1 if there are no signs of poor behavior but there is no stated code of conduct.
-   __User base__ - Score 2 if there clearly is an active and engaged user base. Score 0 if there is little or no evidence that the product is actually being used by anyone beyond the development team. Score 1 if there is some evidence of use but not much.

Once you have filled in your evaluation for each of the criteria, total your scores for the project overall.
