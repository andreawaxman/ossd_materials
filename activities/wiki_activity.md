# Wiki activity

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is most likely the largest open source
project out there. It may not require the contributors to write source code
(unless, of course, you wish to contribute to the [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org)
project - an open source software that runs Wikipedia and other similar sites,
but we can learn a lot of lessons about collaborative open source projects
from it.
