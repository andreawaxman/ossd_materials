## `git` / GitHub exercises 

A __student survey__ to see what they know 

[Git intro activitiy](https://github.com/StoneyJackson/git-intro-activity) - students work in pairs (the person with 
more `git` experience should be the recorder, the person with less experience should do the actual exercise) 


[GitHub workflow activity](https://github.com/StoneyJackson/github-workflow-activity) - starts with the slides, then 
students work in groups of 2-3 (forks, branches, pull requests, pulling changes from upstream) 

## Licenses 

Watch Tom Callaway's talk [Understanding FOSS licenses (without a lawyer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTYuDrQpyH0),
