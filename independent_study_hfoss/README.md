# HFOSS (Humanitarian Free Open Source Software) <br>Independent Study

## Initial readings and materials

__[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain)__ by Eric Steven Raymond - this is a classic introductory essay that explains some ideas behind open source development. The entire book can be accessed at [Eric Raymond's site](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/). (Note that the essay has the same title as the book. It is the second essay in the entire book.)

__[What is Open Source?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c0IrsDsNaw&feature=youtu.be)__ by Mozilla - in this short video, Mozilla employees explain what "open source" means to them.

__`git` Version Control Readings/Tutorials/Practice__

- __[ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)__ by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, (first three chapters) - this is a good introduction/review of the basics of `git` version control system.
As you start working on the projects that use `git`, the later chapters might come in handy as well.

- If you are not comfortable with using git from the terminal, go through the __[tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)__ tutorial

- __[Katocoda: Git Version Control](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)__ - explore
different scenarios that may arise and learn how to resolve them. (Note: I have not tried
  these yet, but they come highly recommended.)

- For resolving some potential future issues with Git and GitHub, you might
want to keep __[git-flight-rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)__ on hand. <br>
This project is open for contributions as well.


## Starting with projects

- __[Project Evaluation - OpenMRS](../activities/project_evaluation_OpenMRS.md)__ - This
activity walks you through a project evaluation steps (i.e., how to decide if a particular
  open source project is a good fit for your own contributions).

- Repeat the above project evaluation for [Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/) project. Note
any differences from OpenMRS when it comes to finding the information.

- Repeat the above project evaluation for a project of your choice (preferably
  with a humanitarian / social good aspect).
