    - identity of the person reporting it
    - severity
    - description of the _incorrect_ behavior observed
    - details about how to reproduce it
    - details about environment in which the bug was observed
    - status of the bug (new, assigned, resolved, closed, ...)

# Bug Triage

Bug Triage (or Grooming or Gardening) is the process by which projects:
- confirm new bugs that have been submitted
    - is it a new bug report or a duplicate one
- gather more information about the bug when necessary
- prioritize confirmed bugs
- review bugs to ensure that they are being worked on
- retire old bugs

--

Triaging bugs is a valuable contribution to the project.

Triaging guides:

- [Gnome - Triage Guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide)

- Wikimedia's [Bug management / How to triage](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Bug_management/How_to_triage)

- Mageia [Triage guide](https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Triage_guide)

# www.codetriage.com

The [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) site lists hundreds of projects and their issues that need triaging.

TODO

- sign up to receive triage emails

- triage some issues

---
# Let's triage the issues reported for the course website

- Proper way of marking duplicates:

    Duplicate of #5

    (where #5 is the number of original bug)

- Don't close issues without explaining why they can be (or should be) closed

- Be careful when using # - #6 becomes a link to the issue #6 (this makes little sense when you are talking abut Class #6)

- Remember to use markdown formatting [link](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
